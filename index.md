### About Me

I’m a researcher at the [Humboldt Institute](https://www.humboldt.org.co/) in Colombia and a collaborating researcher at the [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/). Broadly, I work on machine learning for ecological problems. Specifically, I work on bioacoustics and ecoacoustics in different groups such as amphibians, bats, birds, insects, and the soundscape. Recently, I started to work on computer vision for automated monitoring of insects. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [National University of Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/) in the Mathematics Department working with [Prof. Francisco Gómez](https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/) where I worked on interpretability in healthcare and diverse problems in policy.

### Research Interest

Ecology and biodiversity monitoring have a symbiotic relationship with machine learning. On one hand, machine learning offers a set of novel methods to process, extract, and analyze ecological data. On the other hand, ecology could be seen as a playground for exploring the scientific foundations of machine learning. Ecological systems are unique in scale, complexity, and richness. These problems often involve multiple parties for combinatorial decisions in highly dynamic and uncertain environments. Hence, machine learning challenges arise as domain shift, spatiotemporal correlations, fine-grained categories, learning across data modalities, self-supervised representation learning, human-machine collaboration, and long-tailed distributions. Finally, I'm also interested in how to work together with local communities to co-create conservation tools that have an impact on biodiversity conservation.
